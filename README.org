* Emacs
I switched from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doomemacs]] to [[https://github.com/abougouffa/minemacs][Minemacs]]
because I found ~doomemacs~ to have many unnecessary customizations, too heavy for my liking.

I migrated my [[https://github.com/hmanhng/.minemacs.d][.minemacs.d]] configuration to a new repository for easier modification and maintenance.
